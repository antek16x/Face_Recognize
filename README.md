# Face_Recognize
The purpose of this application for Android devices is to use the Microsoft Face API to not only detect individual faces in images but also provide certain information about them (age, facial hair, gender, smile). However, before we see all this information, a note is displayed on how many adults and children there are in the picture (age limit 18 years)
